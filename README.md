# QuantaVerse üöÄ

# The World's First Quantum-Resistant & Sentimentally Aware Social Media Platform  

**QuantaVerse** is a revolutionary social media platform built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain that addresses the critical vulnerability of traditional blockchain systems to quantum computing attacks. While most blockchains claim security through cryptography, they rely on ECDSA which is vulnerable to quantum attacks. QuantaVerse fills this gap by implementing **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms**.  

But QuantaVerse is not just about security - it's also **sentimentally aware**. Our advanced AI models analyze user interactions and content sentiment to ensure a healthier online environment.

## üéØ Problem Statement  

- Current blockchain systems use ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) which, while secure against classical computers, can be broken by sufficiently powerful quantum computers using Shor's algorithm. This poses a significant threat to the security of blockchain networks and user data.  

- At the same time, **major social media platforms** face a different but equally harmful problem - their recommendation algorithms are optimized for engagement, not well-being. If a user interacts with or likes a sad or depressing post, the system interprets it as a preference and floods their feed with similar negative content. This feedback loop can worsen **mental health**, trapping users in cycles of sadness or toxicity instead of promoting balanced, uplifting interactions.  


## üõ°Ô∏è Our Solution  

QuantaVerse implements **Post-Quantum Cryptography** using:  
- **Kyber512**: For quantum-resistant key encapsulation  
- **Dilithium2**: For quantum-resistant digital signatures  

This ensures our platform remains secure even in the post-quantum era.  

But security alone is not enough - **QuantaVerse is also sentimentally aware**. Our AI-driven models address the mental health issues caused by traditional engagement-based algorithms by:  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Detecting when users are engaging with too many sad or depressive posts and balancing their feed with uplifting, positive content.  
- **Hate Speech Detection**: Identifying and filtering hateful or abusive content, even when expressed in **regional languages and slang**.  
- **Bot & Spam Prevention**: Ensuring genuine, authentic user interactions by filtering out malicious accounts and spammy activity.  

Together, these innovations make QuantaVerse both **quantum-secure** and **mentally healthier** than existing social platforms.

Authentication Flow:
1. User Registration ‚Üí Generate PQC Keypairs ‚Üí Store Private Keys (AES-256)
2. User Login ‚Üí Create Challenge ‚Üí Sign with Private Key ‚Üí Verify Signature
3. Passwordless & Quantum-Resistant Authentication ‚úÖ
4. AI Models Monitor Content ‚Üí Sentiment Balancing + Hate Speech Filtering + Bot Prevention


## üîê Passwordless Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**: User enters username/email ‚Üí System generates Kyber512 & Dilithium2 keypairs ‚Üí Private keys stored in browser extension with AES-256 encryption
2. **Login**: User enters email/username ‚Üí Backend creates cryptographic challenge ‚Üí Extension retrieves & decrypts private keys ‚Üí Signs challenge ‚Üí Backend verifies signature

   ```
5. **Deploy Frontend to ICP**
    Navigate to `scripts` directory 
   ```bash
   ./deploy-icp-frontend.sh
   ```
   - The script will automatically install npm packages for frontend too no need to install them earlier.


### Usage
